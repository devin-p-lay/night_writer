# night_writer


EARLY STAGES:
My night_writer.rb file is initialized with an input and output file path to direct my command line interface input.



I created 3 methods to begin with:


'print_text' will output to the terminal what is in my message.txt file

&

'cli_input' will receive input from the user

&

'read_and_write(file_path)' will send CLI input to my message.txt file

```

In these early stages, i am only working with my initialize and my first method
