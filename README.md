# night_writer



My night_writer.rb file is initialized with an input and output file path to direct my command line interface input.

```ruby

I started with 3 methods:

'print_text' will output to the terminal what is in my message.txt file

&

'get_cli_input' will receive input from the user

&

'read_and_write_to_file(file_path)' will send CLI input to my message.txt file

```
